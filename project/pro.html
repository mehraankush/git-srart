        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups crushed Italian (plum) tomatoes (such as San Marzano)</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) can oil-packed tuna, drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir anchovy and capers in hot oil until anchovy crumbles, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine, oregano, and red pepper flakes into the skillet and increase heat to high; cook until mixture reduces and about 3 tablespoons of liquid remain, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir tomatoes into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Season tomato mixture with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir tuna and 1/4 cup parsley into tomato sauce, breaking up tuna with a wooden spoon while stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and still slightly firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain and transfer spaghetti back to the pot.</li>
            <li>Pour tomato sauce over spaghetti into the pot; stir to combine, cover the pot with a lid, and let sit until spaghetti is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Ladle spaghetti into bowls, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and parsley over the top.</li>
        </ol>
